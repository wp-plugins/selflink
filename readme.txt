Here is a short description of the plugin.  This should be no more than 150 chars.  No markup here.

== Description ==

Too often, you'll need to add a hyperlink to a post itself in your WordPress? blog due to many reasons, protecting your intellectual property for example. Remember how you made it? Boring enough?

Yes, because the post hasn't been published yet, you have to use preview to see the URL of the post, you set the Permalink manually or you know the postId of the post and set the hyperlink yourself.

This plugin can save you a lot efforts. It will automatically add the link to the post itself when visitors viewing your post. 

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `selflink.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. When editing a post, use [sl] and [/sl] to surround the text you want to add a link to the post itself.
